## Master Theses
### [A spatial analysis of innovation in regional Europe](http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/7615461 )
Implemented a spatial autoregressive model to successfully explain the agglomeration of innovative regions in Europe.
### [The gravity of tacit knowledge flows in the presence of ICTs](http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/8900542)
Adapted the model of gravitational force to trade to explain the importance of geographical distance in the flow of knowledge, regardless of the recent advances in information communication technologies.

## Writing
### [From prediction to decision making](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-your-predictions-might-be-falling-short-opinion-9b1fada35137)
Article in Towards Data Science on the common misunderstanding of correlation and causation.
